This is a collection of all my solutions to the exercises featured in the book Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke.

I decided to use Jest alongside the book to learn and practice writing unit and integration tests, ensuring clean and working code.

This project has 100% test coverage.

Highlights:
Exercise 4.3 - I found a recursive solution to convert an array to a list that is 2ms faster than the book's solution.
