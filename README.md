This is a collection of all my solutions to the exercises featured in the book Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke.

I decided to use Jest alongside the book to learn and practice writing unit and integration tests, ensuring clean and working code.

This project has 100% test coverage.

## Highlights:

[Exercise 4.3](https://github.com/philliplankford/eloquent-js/blob/fb200d925a1ca7fb7681612a1486b852b30d7ec8/chapter-4/chapter-4-exercises.js#L51) - I found a recursive solution to convert an array to a list that is 2ms faster than the book's solution.
